# BlazorGrid
BlazorGrid is yet another grid component for Blazor. I was inspired to write this because I've been using jQuery.DataTables for a long time and felt that incorporating more than 15,000 lines of JavaScript into my Blazor application probably wasn't the best approach. 

The primary goals of this component are:
- Displaying remote data
- Sorting, searching and advanced filtering of remote data
- Require as little markup as possible to define the grid
- Highly customizable UI by providing SCSS
- Using a customizable data provider (which can use JSON, gRPC or anything else as a source)
- High performance by intelligently preventing unnecessary render events
